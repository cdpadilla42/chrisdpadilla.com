Wanted to say two long-time personally desired features now exist on this site: Searching blog articles and an ["On This Day"](on-this-day) page. (See the fancy new magnifying glass icon towards the top right!)

The On This Day page is another way of [tending the garden](/blog/digital%20Garden). It's admittedly most interesting to me since I can dip in and see the seasonality of thoughts and projects. And, of course, it adds [topography](/backlinksinjs) in a new dimension.

The search feature is one _I've_ personally needed as well. Of course, searching markdown in VS code is a breeze. But when out in the wild, armed only with a phone, trying to remember if I've written about something, or searching for a quote I've posted, it'll now be handy to do so.

If the spelunking intrigues you, have at it!
