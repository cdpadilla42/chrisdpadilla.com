_[Why Bother?](https://substack.com/home/post/p-152355451)_ From [Kyle Webster's](https://www.kyletwebster.com/) [newsletter](https://substack.com/@kyletwebster):

> It’s not that your work, itself, will change the world; no, only a few people in history will create something that resonates so strongly that it forces people to stand up, pay attention, and actually act on the feelings your masterpiece has stirred within them.
>
> Instead, it’s the mini-milestones you achieve while doing your work that matter because each of these little ‘wins’ makes you feel good. Feeling good is the foundation for doing good. Positive emotions facilitate cooperation, unity and understanding in a community.

It's not explicitly said, but I'll add how wonderful it is that skill does not necessarily make a difference. The doing and growing are what gives life and bouyancy. Engagement > Product.
