The sun is coming back out and I am loving it! ☀️

## Blogging & Dev

Fun month of blogging! I'm wrapping it up on researching JavaScript testing and am switching over to SQL.

Tailwind redesign is still kicking at work! We got docker up and running, too! 🐳

Meetups are great! I had a blast again at React Dallas! If you're in the area, come on out! It's such a great group of folks. ⚛

You can catch up with my tech projects through [the Tech tag on my blog](/blog/tech).

## Music

I released [Whiteout](/whiteout) this month! Snuck it in right as it started warming up outside.

On a trip up to UNT, I got to wander around my old stomping grounds at the College of Music. It was so rejuvenating to be up there. I lovingly wax nostalgic on the place as "my own Disney World for Music."

I did a few piano recordings while I was there, too! [The Bach Prelude in C](/bachcprelude) is my favorite, such a dreamy piece...

## Drawing

I finished my [second](/sketches-2023-03-12) **AND** [third](/sketches-2023-03-26) sketch books this month! 📒 Dried out my first fine liner! 🖊 I'm crossing right through those artistic rights of passage.

I'm just about wrapping up [Drawabox](https://drawabox.com/) with lots of studies on animals. I'm currently on the hunt for resources for studying the human figure next.

## Words and Sounds

### 📚

- [Tolkein's Fellowship of the Ring](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61215351-the-fellowship-of-the-ring) is going to take me a while, y'all. 🐉 So far so good, though. It's very cozy — lots of words dedicated to eating supper.
- [Form & Essence: A Guide to Practicing Truth](https://www.lulu.com/shop/matthew-hinsley/form-essence/paperback/product-dwke49.html?page=1&pageSize=4&q=hinsley%20form%20%26%20essence) I took an arts admin class with Matt back at UT. Matt is such an amazing embodiment of the servant leader, and this book feels like I'm getting to take the best bits of his class all over again.
- I have a few words written through [the Books tag on my blog](/blog/books). My favorite this month: [Software is Measurably Valuable Creation](/valuablecreation)

### 🎧

- My friend Thomas Kurtz gave a beautiful recital in Austin! No sound online yet, but [all of his recordings are gorgeous](https://www.youtube.com/@512w/videos).
- [The Black Box by aivi & surasshu](https://youtu.be/t7JxSEg6rfc). An old favorite. I love the mix of classical and chiptune by the composers of Stephen Universe.
- [Lumi by Snail's House](https://0101.bandcamp.com/album/lumi). Kawaii Future Bass at it's finest.
- [Brasilian Skies by Masayoshi Takanaka](https://open.spotify.com/album/0zXeZw0oFC2Db99RqlfHur). The king of City Pop never disappoints. I admit that Star Wars Samba is a favorite track.

### 📺

- New Ted Lasso is pretty good! The Apple product placement is strong this season. 📱
- We're trying out a few others - Shrinking and The Big Door Prize. So far so good!

## Life

Really grateful for some sunshine and warmth! The end of winter is always pretty tough, and this one felt extra long here in Dallas.

It's mostly been heads down for Miranda and I. My favorite nights this month have been the couple where we've put on some music and drawn together.

The best vibe was when we [drew camels and snails](/sketches-2023-03-19) while listening to [Arooj Aftab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRZ98HX1MO8&ab_channel=AroojAftab)! 🐌 🐫
