A series of studies done as part of [Jeremy Vickery's Painting Light course](https://www.lightingmentor.com/).

One fellow student left a note saying that the course felt a little like the [draw the owl meme](./howtodrawthetick.md). There's some truth to that — for the most part, Jeremy is providing a set of photos, telling you what sort of aspects of light to look for, and then having you take a jab at it on your own for the most part.

I was having this conversation recently where I shared that, looking back, great teachers do a lot for their students. But I think the benefit many people are really looking for is permission to do a project, and holding a container for doing the work. On the surface, that's a low bar. In practice, though, it's highly valuable and not so simple to do.

The drop into the deep end of observation is part of the strength here. By starting in observation, it's possible to paint anything you see. From there, then technique, construction, lighting principles, etc. can help streamline that process and lend to further creation from imagination.

The biggest "Aha" for me was in the images above and below. Both highly reflective material, I assumed they were advanced subjects. At the end of the day, though, once you sit down and really observe what you're seeing, there's not much more you need to know or do. You simply draw [whatever truth](./lessonsfrompainting2024) is in front of you.

More to do next year in the course! Excited to keep going. I've also added this to my [handy-dandy page of learning resources](./learningresources).
