From "The Listening Book" by W.A. Mathieu. Full title of the essay says it all: _There's Not Much to Learn and It Takes Forever_

> The truth is, a musician can spend a lifetime learning five notes and still not know everything in them. The more masterful you become, the deeper becomes the mystery and the more you are a beginner.
> 
> So when a student feels sluggish in learning a certain mode or cross rhythm, I have to say how there is hardly anything there to learn but that it takes more than one life.
> 
> ... there is no ought-to-know-how, there is only the uncovering of ourselves when we sit at the polishing stone.

It was in my Masters, after 15 years of playing, that I started to think I was getting the hang of things. Only to find out 5 years later that there's much, _much_ more to learn.
