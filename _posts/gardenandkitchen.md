It's helpful to think of projects in a couple of ways: one organic, one structured.

A grapevine doesn't bear its fruit right away. The garden is a messy place where plants can come and go. Some bloom before others. Make a dish with what's on hand.

The Kitchen, however, is where those fruits need to be pulled together to make a dish. After seeing what has grown, a meal can be decided on, additional ingredients picked up from the grocer, and so on.

You see what I'm trying to say here?

It's good in your practice to have a garden. To let the organic nature flow through what you're doing. Let curiosity lead, and allow yourself failures and dead ends. Don't feel too tied to any project.

Then, take a set time to give shape to your work. See what's gained traction and what's ready to be harvested. From there, you can start dicing tomatoes, peeling carrots, and boiling potatoes. There's a goal and a structure here. Though, it's all the more delishish because the dish is cooked with fresh, homegrown ingredients.

The other approach is to pick a recipe, go to the store, and buy the necessary ingredients. Sometimes, that's what you have to do. It's purely goal-oriented, without the spontaneity of what's in season.

So pull from the garden. See what ripens next for your kitchen.
