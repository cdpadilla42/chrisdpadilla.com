Some folks are discouraged when readers barely spend any time with their full body of work.

Each individual message or piece, in my mind, isn't that important, though. It's the culmination and the practice that matters.

What I love when I see someone who writes regularly is that they are taking time to live more deeply.

That's [a big benefit of writing](https://poets.org/poem/student-who-used-ai-write-paper) in the first place. But it doesn't stop after a piece is done.

Consider what it takes to publish something, even in today's near instantaneous environment:

- Having an experience
- Forming a response
- Considering how to communicate that experience
- Editing (either a re-read or several rounds of massaging...or not!)
- Optionally, audience considerations (tailoring to a niche, or generalizing for a broad audience)
- Putting the work through the banal parts of your publishing platform.

This all takes much more time than it does to read the thing. At multiple points, there's an opportunity to relish in an idea or experience. Depth happens naturally, then.

As much as I would love to, I don't get to the bottom of every person's full archive. But the main influence has already had its impact â€” a spark has been lit by another flame shining brightly.
