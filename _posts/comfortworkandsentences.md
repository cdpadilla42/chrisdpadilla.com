Technique is a bit of a vice for me.

When in doubt, I draw boxes.

When in doubt, I play scales.

When in doubt, I mess around with a toy app in software.

It's my vice because I'm guilty of probably practicing too much technique and not just making things more often. But there it is. It's my ["comfort work" as Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.substack.com/p/comfort-work) puts it.

To each their own. It gets me in the studio, in front of the piano, and in my code editor. Usually, that's where I need to start to get to the really good stuff, anyway.

I'm at least in good company. In The Writing Life, Annie Dillard shares an interaction between a fellow authorand a student where the student asks "Do you think I could be a writer?" Their response:

"Do you like sentences?"

I like sound and lines. I even like the colored text in VS Code! So I'll take it as a sign that I'm in all the right crafts.
