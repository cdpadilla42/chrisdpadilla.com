This ol' comic book mascot is my new favorite variant of the old "How to Draw an Owl" meme.

While I understand the actual frustration that this and similar jokes jab at (there are plenty of examples of poor instruction out there), there does come a point where a teacher, book, tutorial, has to let go of the student's hand. You just have to... draw the Tick.
