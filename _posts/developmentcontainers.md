I saw the future in action with development containers and Github Codespaces last night! Really great presentation from [Sebastian Steins](https://bas.codes/) and Nicolai FrÃ¶hlich from Europe!

The talk dove into [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) as well as [Development Containers](https://containers.dev/). 

The gist is that moving the development environment to a cloud based host eliminates the friction of downloading packages, walking through the bash script that manages those downloads, and synchronizes all versions between dev environments.

Really interesting process! Nicolai highlighted that one benefit to this would be to have access to higher processing power than what's on your machine. When I was fiddling with modern development as a music teacher, I only had a $200 Chromebook, with miserable performance specs. Would have been great to play with this back then! ðŸ™‚

I'm excited to experiment more with these setups!
