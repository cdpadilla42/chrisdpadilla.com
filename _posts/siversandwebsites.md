A surprisingly technopositive view from [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/getme) on AI learning from your own public content:

> Come and get me. I want my words to improve your future decisions.
>
> Iâ€™m trying to thoroughly write my thought processes, values, and worldview, so that you can remember it, re-create it and improve upon it. (Remember me. Re-create me. Improve upon me.)

Another case for how a website can become [a life's work](https://austinkleon.com/2020/09/09/15-years-of-blogging-and-3-reasons-to-keep-going/). And how that life's work can have impact, even if it's obfuscated. Perhaps that's the ego-less way of viewing it, assuming your words and images will be taken out of context and converted to a single data point in a larger model.

Though, a site unto itself is still more inspiring since it's a portrait of a life. We're wired for that. There's more meaning to derive from an individual than a summarized report.

So I think I'll [keep at it](/firstblogversary).
