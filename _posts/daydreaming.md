I love being bored.

It's a stupendously easy problem to solve with quick hits. It's not entirely novel to this generation â€” magazines, books, comics, television, etc. have had a hand in staving off what can be an uncomfortable feeling.

But I savor it when I can. It makes room for one of my favorite hobbies: Daydreaming.

Not enough credit is given to daydreaming. It might be that there's not craft to it, perse. There aren't daydreaming contests, there's no coach I can hire for it. Maybe people see it as lazy. It certainly doesn't fit into a puritan work ethic.

And yet, paradoxically, it's essential, even in pragmatic efforts. Software problems are often solved while doing the dishes. Books are written while on walks. And music is composed in that twilight realm between wake and sleep.

But, I'd hate to justify it with a specific outcome. Much like music teaching advocates who would only speak of the increased SAT scores for music students, I feel that we'd be missing the point.

I will say, writing is a fun vehicle for it. A nice balance of structure and flexibility. A place to watch thoughts crawl through the page, turning here and there, until a piece comes together.

But, nothing quite beats having time to stare at the ceiling and see where the thoughts go. There's a magic to it, ["between the click of the light and the start of the dream"](https://youtu.be/T703EHtdPwo?si=6s2lmcjNDICYXiXg&t=192).
