![mama mia: Fan painting of Super Mario 64. Mario soars across a candy coated twilight sky. A floating island in the distance marks his launching point.](http://res.cloudinary.com/cpadilla/image/upload/v1752373785/chrisdpadilla/blog/art/vtnijy4amz94cbyze5q8.jpg)

[Wahoo!](https://youtu.be/pb4u9kXeY8o?si=IAPmIl5e3iHWBZYQ)

There's a piece I've been meaning to write about how Super Mario 64 was my medium for curiosity growing up. That running around in these worlds expanded my own, that taking to the sky in game made me curious as to what would happen if you flew into the skyboxes. What other discoveries could be made out there?

But, then again, maybe the painting says it all.
