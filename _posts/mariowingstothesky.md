There's a piece I've been meaning to write about how Super Mario 64 was my medium for curiosity growing up. That running around in these worlds expanded my own, that taking to the sky in game made my curious what would happen if you flew into the skyboxes. What other discoveries could be made out there.

But, then again, maybe this painting says it all.
