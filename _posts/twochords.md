We move pretty quick at work. With code completion and fine-tuned IDE autocompletion, it's easy to really skate through writing software. I love it, it's a thrill to move so rapidly and to be firing on all cylinders.

At the end of the day, I need something to balance it out. A reflex-based video game is not much of a respite.

It's part of why I still play instruments. There's a great deal of [repetition involved](/repetitionandmeditation). Not only that, but it often takes zooming into fine details and spending time dialed in. A nice counter to the day after GitHub Copilot is encouraging me to let it handle the details.

Recently, I started learning a new tune on guitar. After smoothing out the easier sections, I dialed into two chords. G sus 2 and A sus 4. Back and forth, adjusting my hand position, listening to see if all strings rang out, coordinating my strumming. Back and forth. It's painful at first, shifting down to a lower gear. Eventually, though, it's soothing. Even at a fraction of the speed, the sound of these chords together is dazzling.

I wrapped up my practice session. My ears were now awake. A bird sang as it flew by the window. G sharp to A sharp, down to F sharp.
