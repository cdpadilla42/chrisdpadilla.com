Sourced [from Austin Kleon](https://tumblr.austinkleon.com/post/29280342143) in his newsletter this week, [Brian Eno's 2011 Moscow lecture](https://vimeo.com/25170443).

Eno talks on how music (especially classical music) was a performative, hierarchy driven medium. Recorded music, however, takes out that hierarchy and makes the act of creating music more like painting. Really beautiful ideas, the whole thing is worth a listen.
