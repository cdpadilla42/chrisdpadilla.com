The other day I was [waxing nostalgic for the way websites used the full canvas of web tech to subvert expectations](/web2000) (as one does.)

[The website for Tamara Shopsin's LaserWriter II](https://tamarashopsin.com/lw2/) _also_ does a pretty great job at this.

Go take a look before reading ahead!

A few things that made me smile:

- Your intake number is random each time.
- Chose your own adventure style interactivity.
- You get hassled if you don't buy a coke!

And this one is my favorite: You actually have to **wait** a few seconds before getting to the juicy book details. The website playfully builds anticipation!

On the internet in 2023, _that's a pretty big deal!_ When everything is immediate and served quickly, it's a really special experience to have to sit and wait, not due to loading, but by design.

_And_ best of all, it's not all just for fun and gags! Everything I mentioned above ties in so well with the book. It's referential and matches tone superbly.

Honestly, the website alone sold me on the book. I then loved the book so much that I wrote an [album based on it](/tekserve).
