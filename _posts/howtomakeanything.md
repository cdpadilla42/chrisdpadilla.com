I came across Ctrl + Paint recently, another great and nearly free resource for learning to draw.

They have a fantastic video on how to draw anything in a few steps:

The steps are:

1. Research and gather reference
2. Study in context (breaking down the construction of the object)
3. Practice (playing with the form, mixing and matching elements)

The glossed over step 0 is to understand the foundations: "How to render form and light." No small step! But, once you have the vocabulary in place, that's how you handle drawing something new from imagination.

A recurring theme on ol' Chris D Padilla dot com is that everything is the same! Here, for example, is how [Clark Terry](https://www.jazzadvice.com/lessons/clark-terrys-3-steps-to-learning-improvisation/) talks about learning to play and be creative in jazz:

1. Imitate
2. Assimilate
3. Innovate

And hey, here it is for developing in a new programming language:

1. Read documentation/forum posts/books
2. Build a few sample apps
3. Stray off and build a more complex, custom app

The trick behind it, and why the title of Ctrl + Paints video skews just a smidge click-baity, is that each step takes time. The reward, though, is that when you're comfortable with this process, you literally _can_ make just about anything. No need to know everything before starting a project, and no need to master everything right away. Just follow the cycle, and iterate from there.
