A [great write up](https://articles.pragdave.me/p/we-need-a-better-term-than-software) by Dave Thomas on how the title "Software Engineer" simply doesn't cut it when it comes to sucinctly describing what the people in these roles provide:

> [A] good developer can sometimes manage to deliver that value without actually writing a line of code. Developers occupy a unique position in most companies, sitting at the confluence of many business units and their customers. Developers often have a broader picture of how the company works and how things interact that many of the business’ managers. Many times I’ve seen a manager deliver a requirement to a team, only to have the team respond, “we can do that, but why not just…?”

> So, if we’re engineering anything, it’s value, not software...
>
> The people who deliver value by iteratively refining software deserve to have a name for what they do. It isn’t programmer, designer, analyst, front-end developer, or software engineer. It’s bigger than that, and it’s more subtle.

A great reminder at a time where the "programming" part is becoming more and more automated in our work. The contribution expands beyond the specific tools used to provide solutions.
