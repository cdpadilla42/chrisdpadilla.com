I'm [very clearly](/blog/annuals) a naturally reflective person. So I won't miss the opportunity this year to take stock of what was a very big year personally.

My intent [from last year](/2024) was to chop wood and carry water. Mission accomplished.

## Creative Work

A couple of major projects! [Bird Box](/birdbox) is the biggest one. It was a blast making something that used a wide spectrum of the mediums I work in, all for one project.

[Amethyst](/amethyst-zone) is still something I'm very proud of. A convergence of love for Drum and Bass, early CG, and the feeling of being drawn into a world, a la Myst.

Only one other non-project album, [Goose Creek](/goosecreek). Unless you count the whole moving out of state part. That was, indeed, a project!

More of a technical accomplishment, but it feels like home here now that I have [music playing on this site](/musicplayeronsite.md).

## Music

[Proprioception](/learningproprioception)!! I had a great breakthrough with being able to play piano with my eyes on the music and away from my hands this year. A huge accomplishment, and one that will accelerate my piano playing from here on out. It's breathed new life into playing as well. That feeling of soaring is there!

I gave a valiant effort for chord melody early this year, to then switch my focus over to Math Rock and Midwest Emo. Hoping to return to chord melody another time, with more chops and speed across the fretboard. Learning short licks, though, has been an energizing process. The quick loop of practicing and recording has been a great engine this year.

## Art

In some ways a slower year, but a more interesting one. Gaining some fluency in Blender was a fascinating endeavor.

Much of my work has been beneath the surface here. My sketchbooks are fuller, and I've worked my way through a few more courses and books. This is one of those hard-to-quantify improvements from the year. Ultimately, I'm thrilled with the progress.

Summaries here:

- [Blender](/learning3d)
- [Year of Picture Making](/thirdyearofpicturemaking)
- [Sketchbook](/figureprogress)
- [Painting Studies](/paintingstudiesjv)

Favorite pieces:

- [Mario Wings to the Sky](/mariowingstothesky)
- [Dallas House](/sketches-2025-05-31)
- [Corner Office](/corneroffice)

## Writing

Feels free and flowing. A big barrier to getting words on the site came from the feeling that I always had to make these thoughtful, polished posts. Not every piece required that, so I've leaned into [Clippings](/blog/clippings) and a [Links Feed](/links). The site feels more like a notebook in that sense, now, which helps with keeping me engaged openly with it.

## Software

Wild year for software. I have a few AI agents I've developed out in the wild now. And AI moved from being an occasionally helpful autocomplete to an entirely new way of accomplishing work. I'm still learning how to continue to best integrate AI-assisted coding into my workflow. But it has been quite the game-changer.

## 2026 Intention

New projects and habits take a certain level of rocket fuel to break the atmosphere before coasting, reaching the chop wood, carry water phase. Several atmospheres have been broken for the past several years in my world. I have one more big one on the horizon in the coming years. So my intention for this year, somewhat similar to last year, is to simply keep going. Albeit — with a greater focus on "roots" as I've been putting it to Miranda. More foundational studies, more etude practicing, more learning around what doesn't change in software.

One other added twist: taking time to enjoy what's been accomplished so far. I have a tendency to always be pushing, learning, growing. What I find at year-end, when there's time to slow down and reflect, is that new things are born from a slow pace. This year would be a great one to dial back a few of the extracurricular practices above. Leaving room for what's next.

I doubt I'll be able to fully pull back. There's still more to learn, do, and accomplish this coming year. But, there are also many memories to make IRL, more play to have in the practices, and more [daydreaming](/daydreaming) to do for the next chapter.

Happy New Year!
