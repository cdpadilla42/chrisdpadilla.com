From [Justin Weiss](https://www.justinweiss.com/articles/writing-better-tests-with-the-three-phase-pattern/) on how your tests should work in phases:

> 1. First, you set some stuff up (“Arrange”)
> 2. Then, you do something (“Act”)
> 3. Then, you make sure that what you expected to happen, actually happened. (“Assert”)

Lovely. Flexible enough to accomodate multiple levels of complexity, while giving enough of a framework to get you started on the path to testing quickly.
