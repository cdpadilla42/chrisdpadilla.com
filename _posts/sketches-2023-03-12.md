Another sketchbook down!!

This go-round, I alternated pages with two kinds of drawing. One page of drawing from imagination (visual journaling, as I've thought of it.) The other pages studies, largely older pieces by [Louie Zong](https://everydaylouie.tumblr.com/). What can I say, I love his work!

Here's where I started:

And where I'm leaving this book:

The left page is a study on [this painting by Louie Zong](https://everydaylouie.tumblr.com/post/30785217990/9-2-12-day-235-the-first-of-some-hundreds-of#notes).

Big change!! I'm taking less time to get many ideas out at once, and am trying more to methodically get out a detailed character on the page. That tracks for this book!

Here's my favorite page, following Miranda and I's trip to Denver:
