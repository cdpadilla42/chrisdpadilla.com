Summer time!!!

## Blogging & Dev

Taking a slower pace with blogging, but still sharing my adventures in C# and .NET!

You can catch up with my tech projects through [the Tech tag on my blog](/blog/tech).

## Music

I released [Forest](/forest) a while back! An experiment in playing with a few sounds from Ocarina of Time and Chrono Trigger!

I'm digging deep into learning finger style guitar. My favorite so far was this [cowboy waltz](/eminordoseydoe) I improvised on my new acoustic.

You can see what I've shared so far through [the Music tag on my blog](/blog/music). I'm also sharing recordings on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/c.d.padilla/).

## Drawing

![ü•æ](https://res.cloudinary.com/cpadilla/image/upload/t_optimize/chrisdpadilla/blog/art/IMG_3119_dporew.jpg)

I finished my [fourth](/sketches-2023-05-07) sketch book! I'm starting to not treat them as precious and am really drawing loosely in them. It's great, very liberating!

My routine at the moment is studying other artists, drawing from imagination, and doing perspective / figure drawing exercises. Both from [Proko](https://www.proko.com/) and [drawabox](https://drawabox.com/).

## Words and Sounds

### üìö

- [Tolkein's Fellowship of the Ring](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61215351-the-fellowship-of-the-ring) Wow, the "One does not simply..." meme doesn't actually come up in the book! Nor does "You have my bow...and my axe!"
- [Calvin and Hobbes Vol. 1](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77727.Calvin_and_Hobbes) These strips are so delightfully dynamic! I can't believe I've slept on these.
- [Mickey Mouse, Vol. 2: Trapped on Treasure Island](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/10891220) A find at Recycled Books in Denton. The adventure strips from the 30's are so wildly detailed!
- I have a few words written through [the Books tag on my blog](/blog/books). My favorite this month: [Rob Ingles Singing Lord of the Rings](/robingles)

### üéß

- [Rooms With Walls and Windows by Julie Byrne](https://open.spotify.com/album/518syyOKJtmhFFB3uAYkOx?si=u1Yh_AS-TQGQLId15762ww). Beautiful, moody, home grown solo album.
- [This Jungle in Gaming Mix on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twBcMibg1Vs&ab_channel=Camaz) is a special kind of nostalgic.
- [program music II by KASHIWA Daisuke](https://open.spotify.com/album/7aIEHWiuOkDywdjyQyt8CL?si=ORh4IEYaQ7OdCf3mmXx8Qw). Is "Music That Could Be in an Anime Movie" a genre?

### üì∫

- Ted Lassoooooo! üíî
- I'm listening to [Cartoonist Kayfabe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VN7qnb8W6c&ab_channel=CartoonistKayfabe) while I draw. Since comics are a solitary experience, it's so fun to hear a couple of pros geek out over them together!

## Life

It's hot. I'm cold blooded. So I'm in my element! ‚òÄÔ∏è

Had my folks visit for Mother's day!! We had a good time exploring a few museums in Dallas and eating good food.
