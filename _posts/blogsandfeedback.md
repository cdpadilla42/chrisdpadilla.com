_You_ should blog! I've shared my [thoughts on why](findyourpeople) before. [Here's my new favorite introduction to why you should do it](https://disquiet.com/2021/04/10/q-why-blog-a-blogs-are-great/), in Q&A style from Marc Weidenbaum over at [Disquiet](https://disquiet.com/).

Here's my favorite bit on the difference between social media and blogging:

> Q: Why would I blog if I get more feedback on social media than I do whenever I’ve blogged?
> 
> A: It’s in the terminology: Social media is “social.” Blogs are “web logs.” Social media expects feedback (not just comments, but likes and follows). Blogs are you getting your ideas down; feedback is a byproduct, not a goal.
