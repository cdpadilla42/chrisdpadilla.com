- Writing as clarifying thinking
- Abstraction bringing thought to greater abstracts
- Can't help but think of this XKCD comic on python.
  - The wildest package you'll ever pip install
- So now what do we write about?
  - I've slowed as the nitty gritty coding details begin to become less relevant. The search begins for new conversations worth having. Around the product? Simply go up an abstraction, talk more design?
- Editing... Speed gains are huge in development. Though, some of that is lost to the bottleneck of review and revision. Claude code seems to be the best tool in that human-in-the-loop and consistent opportunities for feedback are the primary mode of operation.
