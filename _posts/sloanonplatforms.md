> And I suppose I think a standard for art is that it doesn’t just play a game, but invents one. On an internet crowded with creators eager to obey each platform’s demands, follow their Best Practices (which harden into mandatory genres: quick-setting concrete), there is, I believe, an incandescence to stubborn specificity.

Astute and eloquent as always.

Blogs and websites certainly have their own ecology and cookie-cutter shapes you can fit neatly into. And yet, at the same time, [they don't](/melonandwebrevival). It's that fine control, the distance from metrics and algorithm juicing, the conductor with their back turned to the audience — all of this makes the act of web craft much more fulfilling in the end.
