I've been playing (well, watching longplays of...) The Secret of Monkey Island. It's a game I kept seeing on OC Remix as a kid, filed right next to Super Mario 64, I'm sure.

Folks say this about most early LucasArts point and click games, but MAN, this game has so much character!

It's amazing to see this game across different devices with different hardware capabilities. [This comparison video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoVi1__jNsI) shows how wild the range between definition from the DOS versions to the later CD versions is.

Maybe a disparate connection, but it makes me think of music composition. You write sheet music that's ultimately interpreted by another player.

Or maybe more like web development â€” the development between versions is accounted for so that the spirit of the experience is the same between browsers. Just without the even footing.

I have a soft spot for the MIDI music and pixelated originals, but needless to say the special edition is particularly beautiful.

Fun facts:

The SCUMM bar is named after the gaming engine Monkey Island was developed in.

You can play the Special Edition (which can toggle to an older edition in game!) [on steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/32360/The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island_Special_Edition/).
