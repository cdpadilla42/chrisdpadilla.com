Absolutely fascinating hearing the constraints on developing games and software in the early PC era. Linked above is Rand Miller discussing the way Robyn Miller would have to stack rendering 3D images for Myst back to back while he would go grab dinner.

The whole interview is great for more of those nuggets. The memory constraint of CD ROM read speeds is one I hadn't expected.

Amazing that, even with all the resources and speed available to us today, performance constraints remain a top-of-mind consideration for engineers. Albeit, now for optimization, rather than "will this even run at all?"
