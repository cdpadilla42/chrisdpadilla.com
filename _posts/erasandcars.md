I'm [still](/pratchettandinspiration) [enjoying](/pratchettandlibraries) Terry Pratchett's [Biography](https://www.discworldemporium.com/product/terry-pratchett-a-life-with-footnotes/).

One of my favorite things about it so far is that, amidst all the interesting life stories, milestones, new jobs, new places lived, the _characters_ Terry came across — with all that to talk about, there's still a non-trivial number of words dedicated to talking about the different cars and bikes Terry drove around.

It's one of my first biographies that I'm giving a read, so _maybe_ this is normal? Maybe I skimmed those parts of Will Smith's Biography? Does the Steve Jobs Biography lament that he never made it to driving a Tesla?

I'm only partway through, but I don't think Terry was a motor buff, so that's not why, right?

It's funny to me — but it's relatable. It's a shared experience — those fond memories of "The 100k miles+ hand me down I took to college" or "The Toyota we shared while we saved up money to make it through grad school."

[Some folks](https://chriscoyier.net/timeline/) can mark major periods of their entire lives with their vehicles.

Here's Terry's timeline so far as I've read, ages estimated by context:

- Age 16 — [Dunkley Whippet](https://onlinebicyclemuseum.co.uk/1959-dunkley-popular-scooter/)
- Age 18 - [Mobylette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobylette)
- Age 20ish - [Heinkel Trojan Bubble Car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinkel_Kabine)
- Age 22 - [Morris Minor Van](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Minor)
- Age 40 - Lynn's Austin 1100

On a related note, I bought a new phone the other day. I have to admit, though, it doesn't have the same "The start of a new era" effect that cars do.
