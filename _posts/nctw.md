On and off since moving back to Dallas, I've been playing with the North Central Texas Winds. Dallas is a wild place for concert bands: there are [_twenty-two_ listed community groups](https://dallaswinds.org/dfw-community-bands/) in the DFW area! A wild number, even for a large metroplex!

The group is pretty unique. Hosted by a community college, there are a handful of students. But the band is largely area music teachers, making for a _very high_ level of musicianship for a community ensemble.

It's been a wonderful experience making music with these fine folks! I'll miss these fun Monday night rehearsals.

I'll share below a highlight from our last concert for the season: Alfred Reed's _El Camino Real_

Many thanks to our conductor, Thomas Singletary. A sincere artist, sensitive musician, and passionate bandleader!
