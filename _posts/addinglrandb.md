Very excited to share what aims to be helpful guide for like-hearted creative folks: A _bookshelf_ page and a _learning resources_ page on this site!

[My bookshelf](./bookshelf) has existed on the site for a while, but is now in a fully fleshed out state with all books previously mentioned on the blog in attendance.

I'm most thrilled for my [Learning Resources page](/learningresources)! Spanning frequent domains on the blog: art, music, software, creativity. There are dozens of entries across books and online material. Some paid, but plenty free as well.

Naturally, both will grow organically over time as I give trial to more material.

I owe a great deal to the folks who have been generous with their books and resources online. Switching into software was a winding road that began with [Derek Sivers' book notes](https://sive.rs/book). My initial education in software was structured thanks to the thoughtful curation of articles and courses linked through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). And the initial map for my art education was borrowed from [a generous list by Noah Bradley](https://noahbradley.com/dont-go-to-art-school/). The list goes on.

This blog has partly been an attempt to give back as much as I can. With posts spread across several pages, dates, and subjects, it was time to wrap them up with a bow some of my favorites for learning art, music, programming, and living creatively!

If any of these subjects are your medium, I'm hoping there will be some entries that are new to you, and some that will be familiar — casting another vote for the material.

Enjoy!
