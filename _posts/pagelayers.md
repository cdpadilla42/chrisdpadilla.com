I've just been introduced to the idea of Pace Layering [via Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net/2025/01/13/tech-pace-layering/):

> ...If you feel frustration at how quickly or slowly a particular technology moves, are you considering its place within the layers? Perhaps that speed is because it is part of a system that pressures it to be that way or it being that way is beneficial to the system as a whole.

Amazing to think how transferable it is to other domains. And to have acceptance of the fact that some things are meant to move quickly, others more slowly. The case for government vs commerce in [Steward Brand's original case for this](https://longnow.org/ideas/pace-layers/) feels perpetually timely.

This compliments well with a [bit of advice](https://sive.rs/no-oracle) from Derek Sivers to focus on what doesn't change:

> Instead, forget predicting, and focus on what doesn’t change. Just like we know there will be gravity, and water will be wet, we know some things stay the same.
>
> People always love a memorable melody. You can’t know what instrumentation or production style will be in fashion. So focus on the craft of making great melodies...
>
> Instead of predicting the future, focus your time and energy on the fundamentals. The unpredictable changes around them are just the details.
