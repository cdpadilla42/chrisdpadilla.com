Kyle MacLachlan wrote a beautiful piece in memory of David Lynch [for The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/19/opinion/kyle-maclachlan-david-lynch.html):

> Though my lifelong friend, collaborator and mentor David Lynch was as eloquent as anyone I’d ever met — and a brilliant writer — he was not necessarily a word person...
> 
> How could words possibly do justice to an experience like that?
> 
> It’s why David was not just a filmmaker: He was a painter, a musician, a sculptor and a visual artist — languageless mediums.
> 
> When you are outside language, you are in the realm of feeling, the unconscious, waves. That was David’s world. Because there’s room for other people — as the listeners, the audience, the other end of the line — to bring some of themselves.
> 
> To David, what you thought mattered, too.
