We're doing a lot of migration from one repo to another at work. And it's easy to mix up which-window-is-which when looking at two files that are so similar!

Enter custom Title Bar Colors! Not only does doing this look cool, it's actually incredibly practical!

I first came across this in [Wes Bos' Advanced React course](https://advancedreact.com/), and it's sucinclty covered on Zachary Minner's blog: [How to set title bar color in VS Code per project](https://www.zacharyminner.com/notes/how-to-set-title-bar-color-in-vs-code-per-project). So I'll let you link-hop over there!

If you don't want to pick your colors, looks like there's even a [VS Code plugin](https://advancedreact.com/) that will do this automatically for you! (Thank you [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55904635/14101718)!)
