As kids do, I had a niche affinity. Mine was Smooth Jazz. Houston had a great radio station at the time (95.7 â€” The Wave.) Any wonder why I decided to pick up playing the saxophone?

The Weather Channel, as you can image, only added fuel to the fire of passion. And Trammell Starks was a frequently played artist.

Here's his collection "Music For Local Forecast."

Certainly very of the genre. The Pat Metheny influence is unmistakeable. There are moments where it's not so smooth. "Jumpin'" in particular has the pianist _slamming_ on the keyboard! (I wonder if this is Starks himself?)

For more fun: [TWC Classics](https://twcclassics.com/audio/years.html) lists all the songs played on The Weather Channel from 1983-2002. Trammell had [a great showing](https://twcclassics.com/audio/years-1997.html) in '97!
