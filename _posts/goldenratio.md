Western music is founded on a phenomena in nature. Certain relationships between frequencies create a harmony, a certain sweetness, where there is little dissonance. Art seems to have a similar counterpart in composition through the [Golden Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio).

I've been having fun crawling through the [One Perfect Shot](https://x.com/OnePerfectShot) Twitter account to find film screens of this composition principle in action. A few of my favorites below:
