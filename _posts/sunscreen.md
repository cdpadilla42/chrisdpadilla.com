Anyone remember the hit [Suncreen Spoken Word Song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_Sunscreen) from the late 90s?

I blame hearing this at the impressionable age of 7 for being the reason why I love to both take in ample self-help material and dispense unsolisited adivce.

As journalist Mary Schmich[^1] shares in the original faux address to the class of '97:

> Advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of fishing the past
> From the disposal, wiping it off, and painting over the ugly parts
> And recycling it for more than it's worth

As I move from living in the expansive Dallas metro area to the stunningly scenic town of Boulder, I was thinking about these lines:

> Live in New York City once but leave before it makes you hard,<br/>
> Live in northern California once but leave before it makes you soft.

In my own fan-fiction of the song, I'd add two lines right after that:

> Work with your mind to stay sharp,<br/>
> Work with your hands to [keep patient](/twochords).
