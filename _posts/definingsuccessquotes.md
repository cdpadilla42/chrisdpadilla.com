Music making really pivoted for me once I started asking what success in that realm meant for me. There are plenty of prescribed defenitions. The surprise came when I reached the end of a success script empty handed.

So, here are a few different voices in support of taking the time to answer that question.

From [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/ayw7):

> Never forget that you can make your role anything you want it to be.
>
> Anything you hate to do, someone else loves. So find those people and let them do it.
>
> For me, I loved sitting alone and programming, writing, planning, and inventing. Thinking of ideas and making them happen. This makes me happy, not business deals or management. So I found someone who liked doing business deals and put him in charge of all that.
>
> If you do this, you’ll encounter a lot of pushback and misunderstanding, but who cares? You can’t just live someone else’s expectation of a traditional business. You have to just do whatever you love the most, or you’ll lose interest in the whole thing.

From [Mike Lowenstern](https://www.earspasm.com/blogs/blog/how-to-deal-with-not-doing-music-full-time?_pos=1&_sid=7f7a70c95&_ss=r):

> While I was still doing the freelance/orchestra life, I never felt completely fulfilled. I was working, but I was working with a lot of people who would read magazines during concerts (no, I’m not kidding. They had them on their music stands) and complain during breaks. Many were very, very unhappy. And there I was, feeling their negativity pretty acutely, and thinking to myself, there are hundreds of musicians who would kill to do this job you’re endlessly complaining about. It was around this time that I decided to switch tracks, and to make an attempt to be successful outside of music, and to pour my energy into the business sector to see how far that would take me. It was a good decision for me, and ironically, it gave me the freedom to become much more successful INSIDE the music world.

> ... If you want to feel fulfilled as a musician, you need to ask yourself a few questions:
>
> What fulfills you as a musician?... [And] What fulfills you as a person? Is it playing music you love? Teaching someone else to play and love music? Is it the freedom to do what you want (e.g. without needing to worry about money)? Again, each of these requires a different path.

From Dana Fonteneau:

> Success is a process, not a destination; a becoming, not a formula...
>
> If we don't stop to question the paradigms, we're blindly following someone else's map without knowing where we are or where we're going.
