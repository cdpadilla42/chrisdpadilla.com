As it may be evident from a [few](/sketches-2025-01-25) [projects](/amethyst), I've been exploring 3D modeling!

I have to say ‚Äî it is a hugely addictive process! Molding 3D shapes out of thin air is way too much fun.

[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is my tool of choice. I have a sweet spot for all things Open Source. And wow. What a time to be alive. Growing up in the 90s, there were [a few consumer options](https://youtu.be/EGIwcPA1_34?&t=179) out there. But it's amazing how powerful this piece of OSS is.

It's pretty dizzying when first learning, but it doesn't take too long to get a grasp of the basics of the software. I've fooled around with it for about a month now and no longer feel _entirely_ lost when trying to model a simple object!

For those curious, here are a few learning guides that have been helpful:

- [üìï Official Blender Fundamentals Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa1F2ddGya_-UvuAqHAksYnB0qL9yWDO6): Don't be alarmed that it's a few versions behind. The fundamentals largely apply to the current version.
- [üç© Andrew Price's Beginner Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgEPv5y--4MKpciLaoQYZB1Z): A ton of ground is covered in this one. It moves quickly, but it's a great showcase of what's possible in the software.
- [üêª Louie Zong's Blender Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvk8V_yfR9c): Great introduction to stylizing 3D illustrations.
- [üêà Joey Carlino's Character Modeling for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&ab_channel=JoeyCarlino): Highest amount of A-ha's per minute. Lots of great tips in this one. A good one to watch to start thinking about how you can work efficiently while modeling.
- [üèîÔ∏è Procedural Landscapes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrMee2gcS20&ab_channel=WaywardArtCompany): Just dipping into this tutorial can give you an idea of how powerful the automation and procedural sides of Blender can be.
- [üíø The Simplest Guide to 90s CGI In Blender by SunnyIsOnline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8A8jwE_AB0&ab_channel=SunnyIsOnline): Y'know, this is [the era I was inspired by](https://www.mariowiki.com/Gallery:Super_Mario_64#/media/File:Metal_Mario_Scene_Artwork_-_Super_Mario_64.png). Shows how to tone down Blender's horsepower to be more period approrpiate.

After that, like anything else, you can go pretty far with a few well-worded Google searches.
