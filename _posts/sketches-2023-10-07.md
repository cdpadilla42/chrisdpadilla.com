I give _one_ listen to the Jet Set Radio Soundtrack, and now I get some funny 90s hip hop inspired ditties in my recomendations. Not bad!

Been doing lots of gesture drawing digitally to help get used to the pen. It's a surprising jump from traditional to wacom!

Lastly, I'm sorry to say that [Anthony Clark](https://nedroid.com/) bore the horrible news: #Warioctober has arrived.

<div class="center">

Here is Classic Wario.

I've tried to escape it, but the punishment for skipping out is much more fowl than the ritual itself.
