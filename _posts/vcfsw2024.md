I recently attended [Vintage Computer Festival Southwest](https://www.vcfsw.org). It's a great, no frills celebration of the history and preservation of personal computing. Everything from Atari machines to the single body iMac G3's were present! 

We're pretty spoiled with technological advancement and availability over here in the US of A. It's easy to forget how phenomenal what we have is.

If you haven't fooled with a classic computer in a few decaeds â€” it's an interesting cocktail of experiences! One part nostalgic, a dash of disorientation (how does this work again?), sometimes impressive for the time, and other times quaint. 

One thing that was consistent across the folks I chatted with: Everyone had a story where their eyes brightened, the conversation got spirited, and they could tap into an early memory of being enamored with what was possible with a machine. Be it putting a PC together, playing games, or programming.

If you're really open to taking a step into your own early memories with these machines, there's a unique opportunity. It's a chance to connect with the spirit of why technology matters beyond its pragmatic function: to inspire awe and wonder.
