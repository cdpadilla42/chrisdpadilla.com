My work as of right now isn't largely Test Driven. The scale I work at isn't as dependent on tests to ensure changes in one area of a codebase is not creating unwanted side effects in another. 

*However*, I can't deny the benefits of testing. Of course, having tests in place help solidify the sturdiness of your application. There's a certain reassurance that comes with shipping code that is backed by working tests. Then also while developing, there's a much tighter feedback loop for the coverage areas of your code when refactoring.

Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt in [The Pragmatic Programmer](/pragmaticprogramer) make a much more interesting case: Writing tests leads to writing better code.

I think, largely, there's a parallel here with writing as a mode of thinking.

I mentioned in my [2022 reflection](/2022) that "Articles help solidify knowledge." Put another way, they bring an organization to the otherwise sloshy thought process that our human brain operates under

A quote of a quote: [Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net/2022/12/13/writing-is-the-ticket-to-a-clear-understanding/) links [Mark Brooker](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2022/11/08/writing.html#foot1) on the Magic of Writing with this gist:

>  I find, more often than not, that I understand something much less well when I sit down to write about it than when Iâ€™m thinking about it in the shower. In fact, I find that I change my own mind on things a lot when I try write them down

So here's my understanding: 

Even if you aren't dependent on the tool of running tests locally and in a CI/CD integration, there are still design benefits to writing tests. Code that doesn't have tests may not be testable, which lends itself to a more interdependent design rather than a modular one.
