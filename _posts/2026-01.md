If I have a theme for this chapter, it's roots. Focusing on fundamentals in my practices. Making a move to a city that's very deeply home. And really taking time with my longest, most sincere relationships.

## Houston, TX

Packing up to move to Houston in the coming weeks as of writing this! Boulder has been a lovely sabbatical, I'll miss the mountains, the snow, and several fast friends. But! I realized on a recent plane trip back to my hometown — the moment the humidity oozed into the cabin — that this was home!

## Software

AI assisted development is in full swing across the industry! I appreciate the productivity gains and enjoy the opportunity to think at a higher level more frequently than I previously did in my work. Though, there is something missed when the craft moves several layers of abstraction up. I'm certainly of two minds about it.

With that shift well underway, I'm making dedicated time to more thoroughly studying principles and case studies around system design. If you have any recommendations, [send them my way](/contact)!

Still figuring it all out. You can watch me try by keeping up with my tech articles through [the tech tag on my blog](/blog/tech).

## Music

~~Something is in the works! Nearly done, and excited to share soon.~~

~~Here's one of the major inspirations until then — early Japanese Shibuya-Kei group Capsule's [Cutie Cinema Replay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S-0tesGdGY)!~~

Phone Lines is out now! My first couple of tunes after an big break. Kitschy goodness, this was fun to work on. Hope you enjoy!

Or, you can listen to my own [oldies-but-goodies](/music). I'm still listening to tons of Frutiger Aero, so might I suggest [SkyBox](/sky-box)?

Going somewhat underground here to establish deeper roots. I had a pretty steady cadence for a while of a piece completed a week. But my chops need developing, and my mind needs to wander! So I'm switching to sketchbooks and saving studies on the hard drive alone. I'm sure pieces will still float to the surface, all the same.

You can see what I've made through [the Art tag on my blog](/blog/art).

## Blogging

I don't think I can help myself from doing it, so anticipate more writings on creative practices, software, music, and amateur film criticism. Join the whimsy!

You can see the blog's year-in-review [over yonder](/2025).

As synthetic data and words begin to increase it's portion in our collective daily diet, I still find oasis in the words, music, art, and general creativity of others. Thank you for putting your humanity out there if you do!

These words were hammered out with my digits on a keyboard to be viewed directly by your own physical inputs. If you took the time to do that, even just for a moment, you are sincerely appreciated.

So thanks for stopping by!
