I can't help myself from watching episodes of [The Computer Chronicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Chronicles). These are just tremendous time capsules.

Here's a particularly fun one: Audible has been around longer than you might have though. Below is Stewart Cheifet introducing the service in 1999 (from the Y2K special!):

Amazing to see the sophistication of the player. Not too different from how the iPod handled automatically downloading and clearing your subscribed podcasts.
