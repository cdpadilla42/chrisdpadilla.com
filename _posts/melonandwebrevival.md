Daniel Murray (aka Melon) has [an inspiring post](https://thoughts.melonking.net/guides/introduction-to-the-web-revival-1-what-is-the-web-revival) explaining in broad terms what the Web Revival is. Readers familiar with Digital Gardens and Indie Web will find resonance here, as well as shoutouts partway in!

> The Web Revival is one name for a wider internet-based movement! The name itself is derived from the Folk Revival of the mid-20th century. The Folk Revival promoted a feeling of humanity, creativity and equality at a time of rapid mechanisation; whereas the Web Revival promotes these values in the face of the rapid digitisation that surrounds us today.:

I'm appreciative of the connection to Folk Revival! Folk music is a [metaphor I've previously made](/folkmusic) to creating online. It seems to fit because it implies a couple of things: closely tied to culture, and organically being maintained by a community.

The answer to "What's in it for me? Why make a site?" is sublime:

> That's a fair question, why should you invest your time and energy in the Web Revival? Maybe you relate to some of the ideals listed above, or maybe you're not sure; ideals are nice, but life is not about ideals. I challenge you; don’t think about the Web Revival as a resource for you to exploit; instead, it's an offer; to play, to explore the unknown, to do something just for fun; not for money, status, or because it's trendy.

> Maybe you’ll get nothing out of it, but I think you will! Like many others, I think you’ll find peace, freedom and relief from stress in creating your own digital world and owning your own space. Play is not about passing time, it's about inventing and becoming who you are and who you wish to become. You deserve to experience a web where you are free to be who you wanna be and do what you wanna do; one where you decide how to spend your time, not an algorithm that exploits you for profit. The Web Revival can't fix everything wrong in the world, but we can make it better, one little homepage at a time.

_Beautiful_.

A great case for practicing any art, from drawing to knitting to site making. What's wonderful about web revival is integration. We live in a phenomenal time where creativity can be supercharged by the tech at our disposal. It's as much a shame to only fit that creative energy into the neat rectangular box of a commercial app as it would be to step away from creating online at all, throwing the baby out with the bath water. The spirit of the Web Revival and all similarly spirited movements is to take the best of what we have available to us and create something authentic from it.
