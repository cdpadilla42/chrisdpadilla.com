Sketches from this week!

Went to Reef-a-palooza with my folks this last weekend! Like anime conventions, but for coral and clownfish (and there _was_ a cosplayer!)

Started watching an MST3K classic â€” Cave Dwellers!

Still doing loads of gestures. This new-fangled digital pen takes some wrangling!
