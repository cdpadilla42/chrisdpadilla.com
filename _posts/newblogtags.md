At the end of the year, I noticed a few threads in my blog. Namely tech articles, but a few categories I want to keep following: [Books](/blog/Books), [Art](/blog/Art), and [Music](/blog/Music).

So I'm creating those buckets through tags.

I've heard somewhere that tags largely are more for the author than the reader. How often a visitor filters by tags (or even digs deep in the archive) is pretty minimal.

I think there's still value in saying "Hey, I write about this stuff, here are some thoughts on these things."

But I'll agree, probably it's more for me! When I have a bucket, I like filling it. So, keeping Art and Music buckets will lend to more long term thoughts in those categories, even if this space is largely for technical articles.

Besides, I like the <strong style="background: -webkit-linear-gradient(right, var(--red), var(--blue)); -webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;">colors</strong>.
