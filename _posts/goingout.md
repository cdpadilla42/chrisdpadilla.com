I had a pretty rough day a while ago — poor night's sleep, reached dead ends on projects, and the pup took more wrangling than usual. There was this event I was considering attending earlier in the week, scheduled for that night. But alas, the day knocked me on my behind and I didn't feel up to it.

I thought I'd start a well-warranted evening at home alone by watching Seinfeld from S1E1. Until the monologue encouraged otherwise:

<figure className="reset">
  <video
    autobuffer
    loop
    type="video/mp4"
    playsInline
    controls
    className="full-width"

    <source

      type="video/mp4"
    />
  </video>
</figure>

> Do you know what this is all about? Do you know why we're here? _To be out_. This is _out_. And _out_ is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life... Wherever you are in life, it's my feeling you gotta go.

Needless to say, I _went out_. A rejuvenating time was had. Even better is that feeling of coming home, because —

> Once you're _out_, you wanna _get back_.
