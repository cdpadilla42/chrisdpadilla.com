This month marks five years since I decided to crack my knuckles and learn JavaScript! I started mostly out of curiosity, partly as a pastime to balance my music teaching job, and eventually to explore a brand new career path.

Now firmly settled into the field, I'm surprised with how much I've learned about myself. Particularly, how I _never_ expected to be doing this kind of work growing up, how I'm amazed at how it's been even more fulfilling than when I was teaching music, and how well the field supports alife of exploration.


## Life Can Only Be Understood Backwards

I'm grateful to have [grown up alongside the web](/myfirstwebsite). Heck, I was born just a few years before Windows 95!

Now in retrospect, it almost seems inevitable I'd end up in software. But at the time, when I was younger, it was just a fun hobby with infinite ways to play around. 

I find myself stunned by how well the timing of my life worked out to bring me here. Firstly, by how open and experimental building online was back in the 90s and 2000s.

Jim Nielsen illustrates this in "[Making a Website is for Everyone](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/websites-are-for-normies/)":

> I made my first website as a young teenager because the barrier was so low (and I dropped out of my very first computer science course after the very first class because the barrier seemed so high)... I absolutely love the idea of actively preserving a low barrier to entry for future generations of people.
> 
> The web’s low barrier to entry led me to a career that has been a boon for my life. I hope it can do the same for others.

It didn't even take JavaScript to get a website going then! It was accessible and free. Something very down to earth while also being exciting and full of places to explore!

I also lucked out with a tinge of right-place-right-time with my career timing. I was early on enough in my life to take a risk on switching fields when there was a general need for more programmers. (I know the past couple of years are an exception to that, but I hold optimism that the pendulum will swing the other way with time.) Thankfully, all without the need for a specific type of educational background!

My parents didn't know that HTML and CSS would lead to a career. (Somehow _music_ was more promising to all of us??) If anything, sometimes I was told I was spending too much time in front of these dang computers! But, here we are.

To paraphrase Austin Kleon in [Steal Like An Artist](https://austinkleon.com/steal/): Never throw any part of yourself away. In my case, I didn't realize that putting together websites for music projects would eventually lead me here.

I suppose it's true! As Kierkegaard puts it, "Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards."

## Giving Through Creation

Artist [Carolyn Yoo](https://carolynyoo.com/) and I are both 32. My favorite line from her [23 lessons upon turning 32](https://cyoo.substack.com/p/23-lessons-upon-turning-32) is this one:

> Give however you enjoy giving, whether that’s through food, money, knowledge, or presence. All forms of giving have immense value depending on the recipient.

I have the good fortune of knowing many people for whom **Service** means a direct, one on one connection. Teaching, chiropractic, volunteering. 

I've felt at odds for a while. The type of service I give isn't that type of service. This was especially poignant since I left teaching. How could anything beat shaping the next generation?

However, Carolyn's perspective here mirrors what I've come to find in software. There are some people who's greatest gifts are in engaging with the process of creation. And hey, wouldn't you know it, that's me! 

There are many ways to create things that serve people. What I've found, though, is that software is one of the most well supported, widely appreciated, and broadly impactful mediums to create through.  Likely, if this is your chosen field, your gift is in making.

## Lead With Curiosity

Software has been one of the most natural things in the world. I'm surprised by how never-ending my curiosity is in the field. With programming, I wake up lead by the call to explore something new. And there's no end to where that road will go.

If there's anything to share at this milestone, I'd share advice that I recently passed on to a friend entering the field. **Let curiosity lead the way**.

Put yourself in a position where you have a chance to explore broadly and/or deeply. Continually find new things to learn. Once you've learned and made enough, you'll get paid to do it all over again in a new way, all the while helping people solve real problems.

Maybe for you that's in another field! But I'll say that Software is a discipline where the work supports exploration profoundly well.

Here's to many more rotations in the cycle of learning, creating, and serving!
