How much time does it really take to get fulfillment out of a creative practice?

I love taking on big projects. It's thrilling to see something grow over time, a song come together note by note, or a drawing take shape stroke by stroke.

There have been times in my life where a project has been all consuming, where my thoughts were on it night and day. Going on the hunt is a thrill of it's own.

When things get busy, though, I have my go-to's for simply keeping my hand in it.

Some days it's just pecking at the piano. Others it's plucking strings. Sometimes it's a sketch over break. 5 minutes here, another 10 there.

I'm grateful for that. When the days fill up with obligation, and I sit down to play a few notes right before bed, that's enough to make the magic happen. I'm continually surprised by how little it takes to tap into something bigger.
