Ryan North over at [Dinosaur Comics](https://qwantz.com/index.php?comic=3843&butiwouldratherbereading=winniethepooh&mobile=0) has a fancy new overlay:

> So uh have you ever wished you could read Dinosaur Comics but ALSO be reading newly-public-domain Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet and not-quite-yet-public-domain-but-hopefully-Disney-is-cool-with-it Tigger?? [HAVE I GOT AN OVERLAY FOR YOU, MY FRIEND](https://qwantz.com/index.php?comic=3843&butiwouldratherbereading=winniethepooh&mobile=0). Thanks to [James Thomson](https://pcalc.com/) for pulling it together!

I remember the first few overlays on the site when they came out! Heck, I remember the contest ran for the custom footers also on Dinosaur Comics dot com!

I just _love_ this sort of thing! Really novel ways of creating unique interactions on the web. Call me an old man (I am [30](/30) now!) but _they just don't make them like they used to, do they??_

I'll truncate my nostalgia infused griping to these sentence: Social Media apps have made the web more accessible to more people, giving a platform for voices that otherwise didn't have one. **Awesome!** AND, aesthetically, a minimal approach has overtaken some of the charm from the old internet. Less awesome!

Ok! With that out of my system, here's this â€” I know that not every website was overlaying Winnie the Pooh on top their comics, I realize I'm remembering selectively.

So let me pivot from complaining to praising some of my favorites:

- [Homestarrunner.com](https://homestarrunner.com/) was a webshow/game site/really impressive flash developer portfolio, come to think of it!
- [Homestuck](https://www.homestuck.com/) (then MS Paint Adventures) was a community based-chose-your-own-adventure series (though, I think the community aspect fell off as the series grew)
- Several webcomics used the medium of a web page to hide jokes in the image alt text and even the `mailto` link's subject line!! (Thinking of [Dr. McNinja](http://drmcninja.com/), [Nedroid](http://nedroid.com/), and [Dinosaur Comics](https://qwantz.com/index.php) to name a few.)
- Neopets was a genre of website that was also a game!! You explored the website in the same way you explored a virtual world. Not to mention that it sported it's own [virtual economy](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/neopets/)!

I think the running thread here is the creative ways folks used the platform of the web. Not just as a way of delivering content the way that Twitter does. But to really squeeze all the juice that's in the web as its own medium.

Put another way, [art didn't end at the edge of the canvas](https://sive.rs/ext).

I'm really happy to have contributed my own piece through [AC:NM](/acnm). A whole visual novel, as a website! Jenn and I very much started the project in this spirit and with inspiration from those older sites. That era of the internet really felt like the wild west where **anything** was possible.

On to making more quirky sites!
