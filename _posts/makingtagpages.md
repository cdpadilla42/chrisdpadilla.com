I spent last week doing some [digital gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/). I have a couple of years of posts on this blog minimally tagged, only marking them for large buckets like "Tech", "Music", "Art", etc. I wanted to start threading themes, in part to increase the topography of the blog[^1]. (See my write up on [back links](/backlinksinjs) for a deeper explanation.)

Another benefit is getting to really take in a couple of years of posts and bundle them together. They become more than just one-off posts and now become projects that I can name and explain!

## Tag Pages

You'll see the fruits of my labor on tag pages. For example, on the [Music tag page](/blog/music), I've surfaced these tags:

- [Piano](/blog/piano)
- [Guitar](/blog/guitar)
- [Jazz](/blog/jazz)
- [Improv](/blog/improv)

Clicking each of those takes you into a more refined look at what I've shared. And those tag pages have their own set of tags that can be linked to! For example, on the Piano tag page, I have a list of tags that includes [Chris Learns Piano](/blog/chris%20Learns%20Piano). So thee's a fun bit of refinement that can be done in the search as you click into it.

On special tags that I feel benefit from an explanation, I can provide it. It's a nice entry point and description for a collection. Using "Chris Learns Piano" as an example, I've included a quick blerb:

> I've been dabbling most of my life, but I decided to really go in on learning piano in 2022.

Just enough to give context to what's pulled up.

## Projects

Bringing loosely related posts under tags also helps with encapsulating them into "projects" rather than streams. There's an important distinction there. I got to thinking about it after [Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/2022/04/productivity-sniped-by-para/) shared his own realization: It's important for projects to have end dates.

Here I'll refference my art tages [Chris Learns to Draw](/blog/chris%20Learns%20to%20Draw) and [Chris Learns Digital Painting](/blog/chris%20Learns%20Digital%20Painting). Over on [the tag page](/art) is an explanation of how I've taken the past couple of years to learn drawing and ditial painting from scratch. Context that I don't share with every post.

I'm planning on keeping up drawing! However, I want to put a bow on those projects. They are horizons to move towards, certainly. But along the way, that horizon needs a few land markers and pit stops. They free my mental energy to chose whatever is next conciously.

Interestingly, it's retroactive grouping instead of an initial deadline. I prefer this. It balances the benefit of both a routine feed of what's happening and a more defined project. By sharing what your working are and then later scooping up different peices into a cohesive collection, you get both flexibility and structure. Plenty of people write books this way, in fact!

Grouping my peices up also gives a big confidence boost! It feels good looking back and saying that I completed a couple of year-long learning projecs!

## Favorite Tags

I have a few favorite collections that have emerged.

Number one has to be [Lucy](/blog/lucy), a brief collection of posts where our sweet pup makes an appearance. (She's a regular subject in paintings!)

I don't often have the opportunity, but when I play an [acoustic piano](/blog/acoustic%20Piano), I always savor it.

It's probably evident from what I share, but I do a ton of reflecting. I take every chance I get to do [annual reflections](//blog/annuals) for different milestones. I like marking occassions and celebrating with writing.

## Tending

A garden needs tending. Harvesting and reworking. Seeing what's grown, knowing what to continue watering. The benefit of a long term project like a blog is seeing what sprouts. Seeing development over time. To only post and never organize would miss most the benefit. Revisiting and organizaing brings a cohesion to the organic growth.
