It's February 2019 - 6 years ago from me writing this.

I'm in my first year of music teaching, fresh out of grad school, and in a bit of a rut artistically.

The [normal medium](/sax) didn't seem to fit as it did before. Practicing also felt more laborious than usual, even though I had technique to spare. I had reached a peak on the creative mountain. Instead of living happily ever after, I found myself continuously asking, "What next?"

So I was sifting through Twitter when this popped up:

You may look at this and think "how cute!" or "hah, funny!"

But **I had a moment!**

Seeing this, _everything_ about it hit several aesthetic sweet spots for me! And then, of course, the fact that in an instant, it created an atmosphere and a story, all with very simple melodic and visual lines — that was something else!

Is that **crazy** to say?! Over a silly little animation?!

I won't be shy about saying that I think [Louie Zong's work](https://www.louiezong.com/) is phenomenal! Expressive, loose, playful, and never-ending in output.

And while the aesthetic and subject matter may or may not light you up in the way it did me, I think there's something deeper that struck a chord with me.

Louie is prolific — Sharing something artistic nearly every day - mini albums, small games, remixes, sketches, short animations. You might be tempted to see that and think "This guy _works_ really hard!" You may have also said that seeing me practice in music school. And certainly — I was _working_.

Louie, however, is very clearly _playing_ very hard! Or rather, playing effortlessly!

**That** is what changed the game for me.

Ever since, I've maneuvered through a career change, transitioned my artistic medium, and redefined my relationship to creativity so that it can be uninhibited play.

I'm sharing this story for a few reasons:

First, it's a funny anniversary, but it's the anniversary of a significant moment. So it's timely! And it's been quite a while since I was struck by that lightning bolt of inspiration. I'm amazed at how much closer I've come to living a creative practice I only dreamed of just a few years ago. That's worth celebrating! 2019 Chris would be ecstatic!

I also think it's worth highlighting that, more important than what you practice as an artist, is the spirit behind it. I know coders who carry this same joy and enthusiasm in their work as engineers. I still know classical musicians who are just as light in their work. I can also say that, while I loved playing sax and teaching, there's an even greater joy and sense of adventure behind art, writing music, and software!

I'm also sharing in advocacy for art as deeply important. Pieces are the artifacts that come from a life lit up and inspired by the daily wonders in the world. Ultimately, artists have to create a piece of what they find interesting. Maybe that sounds self-centered. But that interest comes from a place of wonder in something beyond ourselves. So sharing art is a wholly generous act — with the potential to light up a life.

Whatever that resonance is for you, I hope you continue cultivating it.
