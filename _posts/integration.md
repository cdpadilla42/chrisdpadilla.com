A few years ago, I was torn up about leaving the teaching profession. I had this assumption that leaving the career meant that I was letting go of an identity: Someone that mentored. Someone that served. And someone doing creative work.

I was delightfully surprised as I stepped into the work of software. It turns out there's plenty of creativity, daily opportunities to be in service of others, and teaching/learning are requirements for the job.

It's noble to commit to a profession. However, the reality is that the humanity is in the effortless integration between roles and skills. A call with a friend is an opportunity to teach. So is playing with your dog. So is onboarding a new colleague. So is writing a blog post.

The same is true for many of the professions. Do you have to be a painter to be creative? Or are you creative when you come up with a solution to an interpersonal dispute? Are you only a leader if you manage others? Or can you lead by example from a position "lower" on the ladder? Are you only an entrepreneur when you run a company? Or do you find ways to innovate within your team?

The roles are merely robes to wear. Easily changed, we can step into them at any time. You may find yourself wearing certain pieces in unlikely places.
