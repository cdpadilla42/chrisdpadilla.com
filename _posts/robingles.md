I've been listening to Rob Ingles's narration of the Lord of the Rings audiobook. What a treat!

The books are full of songs and rhyme. Ingles actually puts these to his own singing interpretation. A friend told me that Ingles actually got Tolkien's approval for his compositions!

There's such a sense for mood, style, and melody. Really delightful! He really captures the folk feeling to Sam's Rhyme of the Troll:

Tom Bombadil's is probably my favorite. So bouncy, like a woodland Santa Clause. Rob even contrasts the sections with timbre, range, and articulation!! **WOW!!**
