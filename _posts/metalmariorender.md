I have an annual ritual of playing through Super Mario 64. I'm super familiar with the game proper.

A delightful new discovery has been the [original CGI renders](https://www.mariowiki.com/Gallery:Super_Mario_64#Key_artwork_and_wallpapers) developed to promote the game. This one takes the cake for me.

Another fun crate that I've been digging in is [Render96's texture libraries](https://github.com/Render96/Render96Wiki/wiki). (The [Bakku no Oni](https://github.com/Render96/Render96Wiki/wiki/Bakku-no-Oni-%28Series%29) collection is particularly fun.)

They specifically archive texture collections that were used for games like Mario 64. Now knowing how the sausage is made, looking through these really gets the imagination going. In both directions: Trying to see if I recognize a pattern, or imagining what type of model a texture could be applied to.
