Miyamoto:

> Kids today have sports clubs after school. They go to tutoring. They are pushed by their parents. Their time is limited.
>
> Yet, even at school, kids are thinking about video games.
>
> When they think about games that are not in front of their eyes, their sense of fantasy is at work.
>
> Even if one doesn't consider this a form of education, it is usefult to have as one becomes an adult.
>
> I think that is very good.
