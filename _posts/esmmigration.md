I just realized my issue last week was actually due to being caught in the great migration from ESM to CJS support:

This [ESM FAQ](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c) and discussion was listed on Remark's readme. Clearly, the topic is a hot button one.

Same day, I happened to listen to [Syntax's episode on ESM](https://syntax.fm/show/570/node-js-cjs-esm).

Wes and Scott highlight that, for a large part, writing ESM has been the norm for many devs thanks to build tools. Yet, technically we're still shipping CommonJS once Webpack/Babel/Parcel transpile the code.

The burden, then, is on maintainers of open source packages to wrestle with this overhead. I can see why some would opt to take the leap for simplicity and moving the language forward.

With Jest, I had my work [confirmed](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c#im-having-problems-with-esm-and-jest) in another way â€” handling this is largely a config issue.

All said, I feel a lot _less_ crazy knowing that it's because of a broad, industry wide gradual migration. ðŸ™ƒ

P.S.: I understand that mocking is also probably the answer to this issue. It works for [Uncle Dave](https://daverupert.com/2023/01/using-ai-to-appease-jest/).
