Robin Sloan [makes a case](https://www.robinsloan.com/newsletters/finisher/#finishing) for finished works, even while nurturing a feed:

> Finishing only means: the work is whole, comprehensible, enjoyable. Its invitation is persistent; permanent. (Again, think of the Green Knight, waiting on the shelf for four hundred years.) Posterity is not guaranteed; it’s not even likely; but with a book, an album, a video game: at least you are TRYING...
