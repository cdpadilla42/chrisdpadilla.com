## Boulder, Colorado

My fianc√©e Miranda has accepted an associate's role in Boulder, and we're moving on out there!! It's my first time living outside of Texas _ever!_ I'm thrilled for the new adventure. I can't wait to wake up to mountains every day.

## Software

Still doing it, still working at [AptAmigo](https://www.aptamigo.com), still loving it.

AI is a thing. I've appreciated having it as a resource. Meanwhile, like wine, I'm trying to be mindful not to overdo it.

Still dabbling in side projects in my free time. At this moment, I'm spending time with React Native. Mobile development has been fun to explore! Currently working on a toy app, soon to be revealed.

## Music

Still jumping between playing guitar, piano, and writing my own music. I simply love how they talk to each other.

These days, I'm zero'd in on jazz transcriptions on piano and guitar. The harmony is so rich, I don't mind all that much practicing slowly. Even just [two chords at a time](/twochords).

As far as writing goes, I've been really nostalgic for tech-related music, and how technology can intersect with music. [Amethyst](/amethyst) linked above is a great example. Liquid Drum and Bass paired with early CG visuals are very evocative in my mind.

You can browse my [mini albums here](/music). You can keep up with my guitar and piano playing through the [music tag on my blog](/blog/music). I'm also sharing recordings on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/c.d.padilla/).

## Art

For the past couple of years, I've been pursuing a long-time dream of making art. This last year [I focused on color and digital art](/lessonsfrompainting2024). It's been a blast, and I'm amazed at how the horizon spans infinitely off in the distance. There's so much to explore here!

I've since [dabbled some with Blender](/learning3d). CG is a wicked fun medium! Though I feel myself still fascinated by 2D styles.

We'll see where I go from here. Now that I've drilled some fundamentals, I'm trying to keep things open. Leading with curiosity here!

You can see what I've made so far through [the Art tag on my blog](/blog/art). I'm also sharing drawings on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/c.d.padilla/).

## Blogging

I do it when I can! All of the above makes it here, of course, though writing is a medium unto itself. I continually enjoy having a stage to openly reflect and share on. It keeps me honest. I like to think, perhaps, it's helpful to the stray lurker here and there.

In this climate, I can't help but think a fully-made-by-a-human-website is something worth cultivating. A flower poking out between the cracks of a sidewalk in a concrete jungle.

Thanks for stopping by!
