A section from the book _Art & Fear_ by David Bayles & Ted Orland. Highlighting how both practices are in search of universal Truths:

> It is an article of faith, among artists and scientists alike, that at some deep level their disciplines share a common ground. What science bears witness to experimentally, art has always known intuitively — that there is an innate rightness to the recurring forms of nature. Science does not set out to prove the existence of parabolas or sine curves or _pi_, yet wherever phenomena are observed, _there they are_. Art does not weigh mathematically the outcome of the brushstroke, yet whenever artworks are made, archetypal forms appear.

A significant departure from the two, however, is the lived experience vs the theoretical:

> "The main thing to keep in mind", as Douglas Hofstadter noted, "is that science is about _classes_ of events, not particular instances." Art is just the opposite. Art deals in any one particular rock, with its welcome vagaries, its peculiarities of shape, its unevenness, its noise. The truths of life as we experience them — and as art expresses them — include random and distracting influences as essential parts of their nature. Theoretical rocks are the province of science; particular rocks are the province of art."

Is there significance to those unique peculiarities? The authors make the case for it:

> The world we see today is the legacy of people noticing the world and commenting on it in forms that have been preserved. Of course it's difficult to imagine that horses had no shape before someone painted their shape on the cave walls, but it is not difficult to see the world became a subtly larger, richer, more complex and meaningful place as a result.
