      <h2>I Made A Game!</h2>
      <p><Link href="https://acnewmurder.com/play"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AC: New Murder</a></Link> is a murder-mystery who-dun-it in the style of Phoenix Wright, featuring characters from Animal Crossing. The story and art are done by my sister Jenn. I developed the game for web browsers and built out all things software related.</p>

      <p>Oh, and I <Link href="https://letsgochris.bandcamp.com/album/ac-new-murder-soundtrack"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made the music</a></Link>, too!</p>

      <p>2 years ago, my sister Jenn approached me with an idea for a murder mystery game featuring some of the characters from Animal Crossing. I was looking for a fun new way to sharpen my software engineering skills, and I was won over by the silliness of the story!</p>

      <h2>The History</h2>

      <p>What started out as a pretty simple web app for displaying text turned into a fully fledged visual novel.</p>

      <p>And now you can play it!!</p>

      <h2>Playing the Game</h2>

      <p>The game works in tandem with visiting Jenn's island in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. You can <Link href="https://acnewmurder.com/play"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get started here</a></Link>!
      
      {/* If you don't have the game, or just want to go through the web app by itself, you can click here to unlock the items ahead of time. */}
      
      </p>

      <h2>Tech Stack</h2>

      <p>
      The game is a web app, so all you need to do is visit the site to get started.
      </p><p>
      For those curious, it was developed with the same tools I use for software engineering on the web: React, Redux, Node, MongoDB, and more. You can read about it in my <Link href="/acnmp"><a>blog posts</a></Link>.</p>
