          AC: New Murder
        </Link>{' '}
        is a murder-mystery who-dun-it in the style of Phoenix Wright, featuring
        characters from Animal Crossing. The story and art are done by my sister
        Jenn. I developed the game for web browsers and built out all things
        software related.

        , too!

      <h2>The History</h2>

      <p>
        2 years ago, my sister{' '}
        <Link
          href="https://www.jennpadilla.com/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Jenn
        </Link>{' '}
        approached me with an idea for a murder mystery game featuring some of
        the characters from Animal Crossing. I was looking for a fun new way to
        sharpen my software engineering skills, and I was won over by the
        silliness of the story!
      </p>

      <p>
        What started out as a pretty simple web app for displaying text turned
        into a fully fledged visual novel.
      </p>

      <p>And now you can play it!!</p>

      <h2>Playing the Game</h2>

      <p>
        The game works in tandem with visiting Jenn's island in Animal Crossing:
        New Horizons. Completing the game (and enjoying all the cool
        customizations Jenn made in New Horizons) requires a Nintendo Switch and
        the official Animal Crossing game.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don't have either, you can still work through the first act of
        the game to get a feel for the web app!

      <h2>Tech Stack</h2>

      <p>
        For those curious, the game was developed with the same tools I use for
        software engineering on the web: React, Redux, Node, MongoDB, and more.
        You can read about it in my <Link href="/acnmp">blog posts</Link>.
