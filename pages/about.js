          I'm a software engineer and musician from Dallas, Texas. ðŸ¤

      I spend my days writing React and Node code, squashing bugs, and designing
      delightful components.
      <p>
        <strong>I'm an avid learner and maker!</strong> I bounce between
        reading, writing, learning new instruments, composing, and trying new
        things. There's always something new to try!

      <h2>Coding Origin Story</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>I've loved tech since I was a kid.</strong> My mom has this
        story she is embarrased to tell â€” When I was 5, I was so hooked on
        computers that my dad helped me bring our Compaq desktop with us on a
        beach vaction to Galveston.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        There's always been so much to explore and make in the tech space. I
        grew up making custom web profiles, hacking a Nintendo DS to download a{' '}

        , and hosting my creative projects on my first site moomoofilms.com (now
        defunct.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I love community and teaching.</strong> My career began with
        teaching music to middle and high schoolers. I found immense fulfillment
        in helping students break down road blocks and solve problems
        creatively.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>My journey into software was interesting.</strong> I eventually
        found myself working on websites for my teaching projects and musical
        groups just about as much as I was teaching. For a while, wanting to
        develop full time was one of those "Unthought Knowns." After a
        particular "A-ha" afternoon, I commited myself to teaching myself modern
        web development in 2019.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I've been developing full time as of 2021.</strong> It's been a
        blast!

      <h2>Music</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>I've been musicing since I was a kid.</strong> I started on
        saxophone in middle school. I took all the music classes I could and
        dabbled in writing. My biggest influences have been video game
        soundtracks, early jazz, and classical music.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I ended up going to college for music!</strong> Some of the best
        years of my life! I went to UNT for a bachelor's in music ed ðŸ¦… and UT
        for a master's in performance. ðŸ¤˜
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I write music to tell stories and create atmospheres.</strong>{' '}
        Mostly light hearted and playful, I use writing as a means to capture
        what I love â€” other music, people, or moments in time.

      <h2>Life</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>
          I live in the Dallas area with my girlfriend and our pup Lucy.
        </strong>{' '}
        We all love the food here. ðŸ‘Œ
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I have a few hobbies.</strong> I fling myself against bouldering
        walls pretty regularly. I read. Tons! Lots of non-fiction, with
        sprinkles of Terry Pratchett novels and illustrative essays.
