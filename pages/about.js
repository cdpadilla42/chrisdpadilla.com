      <h2>The Gist</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>
          I'm a software engineer and musician from Dallas, Texas. ðŸ¤ 
        </strong>{' '}
        I have been hacking and musicing for pretty much most of my life! I'm{' '}
        {calculateAge(bd)} years old and wrangled my first lines of HTML, CSS,
        and JavaScript on{' '}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neopets">Neopets.com</a>{' '}
        {calculateAge(npbd)} years ago.
      </p>
      <strong>
        I'm currently doing full stack web development with{' '}
        <a href="https://www.aptamigo.com/">AptAmigo.</a>{' '}
      </strong>
      I spend my days writing React and Node code, squashing bugs, and designing
      delightful components.
      <p>
        <strong>I'm an avid learner and maker!</strong> I bounce between
        reading, writing, learning new instruments, composing, and trying new
        things. That's what's so great about tech. I love being a part of a
        community that is constantly improving.
      </p>
      <h2>Coding Origin Story</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>I've loved tech since I was a kid.</strong> My mom has this
        story she is embarrased to tell â€” I was so hooked on computers that my
        dad helped me bring our Compaq desktop with us on a beach vaction to
        Galveston when I was 5. There's always been so much to explore and make
        in the tech space. I grew up making custom web profiles, hacking a
        Nintendo DS to download a{' '}

          midi synth
        </a>
        , and hosting my creative projects on my first site moomoofilms.com (now
        defunct.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I love community and teaching</strong>. My career began with
        teaching music to middle and high schoolers. I found immense fulfillment
        in helping students break down road blocks and solve problems
        creatively.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>My journey into software was interesting.</strong> I eventually
        found myself working on websites for my teaching projects and musical
        groups just about as much as I was teaching. For a while, wanting to
        develop full time was one of those "Unthought Knowns." After a
        particular "A-ha" afternoon, I commited myself to teaching myself modern
        web development in 2019.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I've been developing full time as of 2021.</strong> It's been a
        blast!
      </p>
      <h2>Music</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>I've been musicing since I was a kid.</strong> I started on
        saxophone in school. I took all the music classes I could and dabbled in
        writing. My biggest influences have been video game soundtracks, early
        jazz, and classical music.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I ended up going to college for music!</strong> Some of the best
        years of my life! I went to UNT for a bachelors in music ed ðŸ¦… and UT
        for a masters in performance. ðŸ¤˜
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I write music to tell stories and create atmospheres.</strong>{' '}
        Mostly light hearted and playful, I use writing as a means to capture
        what I love â€” other music, people, or moments in time.
      </p>
      <h2>Life</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>
          I live in the Dallas area with my girlfriend and our pup Lucy.
        </strong>{' '}
        We all love the food here. ðŸ‘Œ
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I have a few hobbies.</strong> I fling myself against bouldering
        walls pretty regularly. I read. Tons! Lots of non-fiction, with
        sprinkles of Terry Pratchett novels and illustrative essays.
