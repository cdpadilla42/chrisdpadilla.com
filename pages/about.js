      I spend my days developing features, squashing bugs, and contributing to
      tools that empower apartment hunters and locators.
      <p>
        <strong>I'm an avid learner and maker!</strong> I bounce between
        reading, writing, learning new instruments, and composing. There's
        always something new to try!

      <h2>Coding Origin Story</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>I've loved tech since I was a kid.</strong> My mom has this
        story she is embarrased to tell â€” When I was 5, I was so hooked on
        computers that my dad helped me bring our Compaq desktop with us on a
        beach vaction to Galveston.{' '}
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I love community and teaching.</strong> My career began with
        teaching music to middle and high schoolers. I found immense fulfillment
        in helping students break down road blocks and solve problems
        creatively. When I can, I'm happy to help a colleague or friend get
        unblocked from a technical challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          My journey into software as a profession was interesting.
        </strong>{' '}
        I eventually found myself working on websites for my teaching projects
        and musical groups just about as much as I was giving music lessons. For
        a while, working in software full time was one of those "Unthought
        Knowns." After a particular "A-ha" afternoon, I commited myself to
        teaching myself modern web development in 2019.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I've been developing full time as of 2021.</strong> It's been a
        blast!

      <h2>Music</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>I've been musicing since I was a kid.</strong> I started off on
        saxophone in middle school. I took all the music classes I could and
        dabbled in writing. My biggest influences have been video game
        soundtracks, early jazz, and classical music.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I ended up going to college for music!</strong> Some of the best
        years of my life! I went to UNT for a bachelor's in music ed ðŸ¦… and UT
        for a master's in performance. ðŸ¤˜
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I write music to tell stories and create atmospheres.</strong>{' '}
        Mostly light hearted and playful, I use writing as a means to capture
        what I love â€” other music, people, or moments in time.
