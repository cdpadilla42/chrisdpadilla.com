		desc: `One of Hollis' most recent works. Similar themes return: finding meaning in servicing "what is seaking expression through me?" Some thoughts on embracing our imperfection humanity in the chapter on the Seven Deadly Sins, similar to ideas in [The Happiness Hypothesis](#HappinessHypothesis). Wonderful to listen to the author reading the audiobook!`

		desc: `My favorite of Hollis' works so far. An assortment of essays geared towards wrestling with the question of personal meaning. Book goes beyond the usual list of "Friends, family, love, honor, good work, etc." to look more closely at what our unique calling is. A wonderful follow up to ["Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life"](#FindingMeaningInTheSecondHalfOfLife). The first book asks questions, the second helps move the reader towards finding answers.`

		desc: `A true music theory book that focuses on resonance as the basis for understanding harmony. This is not so much a quick road to learning how to compose as much as it is theory in guided practice to understand where our harmonic language comes from. If you enjoyed [Bernstein's instroduction to tonal harmony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HjEAtJXssc&ab_channel=LeonardBernstein), this is an entire textbook exploring that foundation.`

Plenty of the techniques are still beyond me, but it's fun all the same. Walt writes with such a fire and emphasis on expression over accuracy. Not to mention his life story - an animator, tennis player, piano player, musician, poet, a real renaissance man!`
