		desc: `My favorite of Hollis' works so far. An assortment of essays geared towards wrestling with the question of personal meaning. Book goes beyond the usual list of "Friends, family, love, honor, good work, etc." to look more closely at what our unique calling is. A wonderful follow up to ["Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life"](#FindingMeaningInTheSecondHalfOfLife). The first book asks questions, the second helps move the reader towards finding answers.`

Some thoughts on embracing our imperfection humanity in the chapter on the Seven Deadly Sins, similar to ideas in [The Happiness Hypothesis](#HappinessHypothesis). Wonderful to listen to the author reading the audiobook!`
