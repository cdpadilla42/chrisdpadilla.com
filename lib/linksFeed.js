    title: 'On the pleasure of reading private notebooks',
    description: `Henrik Karlsson on reading the organic sprawl of private notes. "Browsing through private notes feels more like participating in a happening than reading a piece of literature: this is what happened, more or less in real time, inside another human. Their beauty has more in common with the beauty of nature than the beauty of art. It is sprawling, strange, tangled, and confusing—but the overall work has a deep structure to it that art can’t imitate." Digital Gardeners rejoice: the more organic, the better!`,

    description: `On the origin and proliferation of the cultural narrative around "being creative" as a hero's journey. "Unlike stories about artistic creation of the past... the goal of the contemporary story of creators is not to create something good but to achieve success..." And then later: "...And all of this would be true if any of these products were art. But they’re not. They’re hagiography. They are devoted to turning the author into a sainted artist, toiling away for the good of mankind"`,
